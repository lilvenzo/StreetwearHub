That makes a lot of sense. Instead of a secondhand or community-driven resale model like Depop or Grailed, youâ€™re aiming for a premium, curated marketplace for smaller streetwear brandsâ€”giving them the same sleek UX and shopping experience as MyTheresa, Farfetch, and AboutYou, but without the barriers to entry those platforms have.

Why This Concept Has Potential
	â€¢	Underserved Niche â€“ Small streetwear brands donâ€™t have a platform that gives them the polished feel of luxury marketplaces.
	â€¢	Higher Perceived Value â€“ A well-designed, premium shopping experience makes brands look more desirable, leading to higher conversion rates and pricing potential.
	â€¢	Regional Focus = Less Competition â€“ Instead of competing with global marketplaces, you can dominate a regional niche (e.g., Bulgaria/Balkan streetwear).
	â€¢	Brand Growth Opportunity â€“ Many streetwear brands want to scale but lack the infrastructure. Your app could offer storefronts, order management, and exposure.

Key Features to Consider
	1.	Curated Brand Onboarding â€“ To maintain a premium feel, you might need a vetting process (e.g., invite-only, application-based entry).
	2.	Sleek Product Pages â€“ High-quality imagery, immersive product descriptions, and smooth checkout flow.
	3.	Seamless Payments & Logistics â€“ Integration with Stripe, PayPal, or local payment gateways + potential partnerships with delivery services.
	4.	Exclusive Drops & Preorders â€“ Mimic the hype-driven model of big streetwear brands (think Supremeâ€™s drop culture).
	5.	Localized Focus â€“ Keep it regional-first (e.g., Bulgaria/Balkans), so customers and brands feel itâ€™s tailored for them.
	6.	Mobile-First UX â€“ Since your audience is already used to buying through Instagram/TikTok, the experience should feel native to mobile.

Monetization Models to Explore
	â€¢	Commission-Based â€“ Take a small % of each sale (like Farfetch).
	â€¢	Subscription for Brands â€“ Offer a paid tier for extra exposure, marketing, or premium positioning.
	â€¢	Logistics Integration â€“ Partner with a delivery company and take a cut from streamlined shipping solutions.

This idea has huge potential, especially if you can make onboarding easy for brands while keeping the UX polished and premium for customers. If you need help sketching out a roadmap, branding ideas, or an MVP strategy, let me know! ðŸš€
